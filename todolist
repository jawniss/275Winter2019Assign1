this is just for a list of what needs to be done still

1. when you click the joystick, go to the selection of the restauarants
2. in the restaurant highlighting list part, change so that when you reach bottom (or maybe top too) of list, 
   to go to the 'next page' of the list --> currently loops back to the top
   2.1 when you select a restaurant, teleport to that restaurant's location
3. figure out getrestaurant fast
4. something about when you click the screen, show locations of the restaurants that are on the screen
5. getting the 30 closest restauarants 
   - use the restdist struct, using the restaurants list and the index like 0 to 1066 etc store the index of that restaurant
     with it's manhatten distance --> manhatten distance only has to be updated when you select that restaurant 
     --> to decide which 30 are the closest rests, do when you click the joystic,, run the calculations to find the 
         closest restaurants
